    <h1>Food Experince</h1>
    <p>Food as well as the process of making it has always been a big part of my intrest and I've enjoyed all forms of it. I like cooking just as much as I love trying new foods and learning about them. Cooking shows were some of my favorites growing up, especially the ones that featured Gordon Ramsey. Even though the shows involved a lot of yelling, it created a new sense of appriciation for how the food is made and the effort that goes into it.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
      <p>Over time I've come to like the taste of a few foods more than others, some of these foods include:</p>
      <ul class="short-lists">
        <li>A well-made, loaded burger</li>
        <li>Calamari</li>
        <li>A well seasoned steak</li>
        <li>Delicous tacos</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Favorite Desserts</h2>
      <p>After each good meal, comes a good dessert, here are some of my favorites:</p>
      <ul class="short-lists">
        <li>Sherbet ice cream</li>
        <li>A waffle loaded with strawberry toppings</li>
        <li>Tres leches cake</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dessert is not my favortie category since most of it falls under baking, while I perfer cooking.</p>

      <h2>What I like to cook</h2>
      <p>What my favorite foods are, taste wise, differ from what I actually like making when I cook. There are some foods that are more satisfying to make then others and while I might not necessarily be the number one fan of how they taste, I enjoy actually cooking them.</p>
      <p>One of the foods I really like to cook are breaded chicken fillets that are topped with melted cheese as well as a tomato salsa. It's a food that has always ends up looking great after I make it.</p>
      <h2>Favorite Cooking Show</h2>
      <p>Over the years I have watched a few shows that are about cooking and have grown to like some of them more than others. That being said I like to see what other people's ideas are, even if I might not like a specific show.</p>

      <p>One of my favorites is Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen show. It is a suspenseful show and many times very exaggerated but it makes for a good way to learn about food, as well as see what it takes to be a resteurant chef. Below is a short clip from one of the episodes.</p>
